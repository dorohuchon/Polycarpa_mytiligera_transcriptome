## Trees

**Gordon_all_genes_ML.tre**  
Phylogenetic tree reconstructed based on the all_genes_supermatrix under the LG+C60+F+G model of IQtree (version 1.6.12). Newick format.

**Gordon_reduced_ML.tre**  
Phylogenetic tree presented in Figure 6 reconstructed based on the reduced_supermatrix under the LG+C60+F+G model of IQtree (version 1.6.12). Newick format.


## Transcriptome assembly

**Polycarpa_mytiligera_transcriptome_assembly_120.zip**  
Zipped transcriptome assembly of *Polycarpa mytiligera*. The transcriptome was assembled from Illumina reads using Trinity (v2.8.4). Transcripts shorter than 120 bp were deleted. Fasta format.
